/* CRC description and tables, allowing for double-word CRCs.

   The description is based on Ross William's parameters, but with some changes
   to the parameters as described below.

   ref and rev are derived from refin and refout.  ref and rev must be 0 or 1.
   ref is the same as refin.  rev is true only if refin and refout are
   different.  rev true is very uncommon, and occurs in only one of the 72 CRCs
   in the RevEng catalogue.  When rev is false, the common case, ref true means
   that both the input and output are reflected. Reflected CRCs are quite
   common.

   init is different here as well, representing the CRC of a zero-length
   sequence, instead of the initial contents of the CRC register.

   poly is reflected for refin true.  xorout is reflected for refout true.

   The structure includes space for pre-computed CRC tables used to speed up
   the CRC calculation.  Both are filled in by the crc_table_wordwise()
   routine, using the CRC parameters already defined in the structure. */

    char rev;                   /* if true, reverse output */

/* Read and verify a CRC model description from the string str, returning the
   result in *model.  Return 0 on success, 1 on invalid input, or 2 if out of
   memory.  model->name is allocated and should be freed when done. str is
   modified in the process, and so it cannot be a literal string.

   The parameters are "width", "poly", "init", "refin", "refout", "xorout",
   "check", "residue", and "name".  The names may be abbreviated to "w", "p",
   "i", "r", "refo", "x", "c", "res", and "n" respectively.  Each name is
   followed by an "=" sign, followed by the value for that parameter.  There
   are no spaces permitted around the "=".  "width", "poly", "init", "xorout",
   "check", and "residue" are non-negative integers, and can be provided in
   decimal (no leading zero), octal (prefixed with "0"), or hexadecimal
   (prefixed by "0x"). refin and refout must be "true" or "false", and can be
   abbreviated to "t" or "f". Upper and lower case are considered equivalent
   for all parameter names and values. The value for "name" may be in quotes to
   permit spaces in the name. The parameters may be provided in any order.

   "width" is the number of bits in the CRC, referred to herein as n.  "poly"
   is the binary representation of the CRC polynomial, sans the x^n term.
   "poly" is never provided in a reflected form.  So x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + 1 is
   "width=16 poly=0x1021".

   "init" is the initial contents of the CRC register.  If "refin" is true,
   then the input bytes are reflected.  If "refout" is true, then the CRC
   register is reflected on output.  "xorout" is exclusive-ored with the CRC,
   after reflection if any. "check" is the CRC of the nine bytes "123456789"
   encoded in ASCII.  "name" is the name of the CRC.

   "width" can be as much as twice the number of bits in the word_t type, set
   here to the largest integer type available to the compiler (uintmax_t).  On
   most modern systems, this permits up to 128-bit CRCs.

   "poly", "init", "xorout", "check", and "residue" must all be less than 2^n.
   The least significant bit of "poly" must be one.

   "init", "xorout", and "residue" are optional, and are set to zero if not
   provided.  Either "refin" or "refout" can be omitted, in which case the one
   missing is set to the one provided.  At least one of "refin" or "refout"
   must be provided. All other parameters must be provided.

   Example (from the RevEng catalogue at
   http://reveng.sourceforge.net/crc-catalogue/all.htm ):

      width=16 poly=0x1021 init=0x0000 refin=true refout=true xorout=0x0000 check=0x2189 residue=0x0000 name="KERMIT"

   The same model maximally abbreviated:

      w=16 p=4129 r=t c=8585 n=KERMIT
